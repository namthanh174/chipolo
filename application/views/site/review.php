                        The product made its debut on Kickstarter where it already raised more than
                        $160,000 (ten times the amount of original pledge). Over 3,000 people backed the
                        project with 9 days left on campaign.

                        It doesn’t appear that you’ll be able to view it on a map in real-time, but the
                        application will instead use a radar type tool to help you locate it, and you’ll be
                        able to set up alerts for when the Chipolo goes out of range of your phone. One of
                        the largest benefits of the Chipolo is that it has a replaceable battery, unlike
                        competitors such as Tile where you need to replace the entire device when the
                        battery goes flat.                </p>
